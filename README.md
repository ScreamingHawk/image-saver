# Image Saver

An android app that lets you save images to your phone using the share function.

This app is based on [Phone Saver](https://github.com/ScreamingHawk/phone-saver) but only allows saving images.

## Description

Ever hit that share button and really just wanted to save that image on your phone?
That meme that you send to your friends that would be great in your reaction image folder.
That screenshot of that Snapchat that you want to hide in a secret folder.

Well look no further!

Set up any number of locations on your mobile, and save to them with a single click when using Android's share feature.
